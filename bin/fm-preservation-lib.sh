# Shared library for the AgentLab evidence-preservation gate
# (docs/evidence-preservation-lifecycle.md in yagakeerthikiran/agentlab-shared-memory
# is the canonical contract; this file is firstmate's mechanical enforcement of it).
#
# Owns the durable receipt log at state/<id>.preservation (append-only JSON
# Lines, one object per recorded checkpoint) and fm_preservation_verify, the
# single check every gate (fm-spawn.sh, fm-promote.sh, fm-teardown.sh) calls
# before it allows a lifecycle step to proceed. Never rewrite or truncate the
# receipt log: it is the audit trail a captain waiver and a later dispute both
# depend on.
#
# A receipt line carries: kind (initial|update|final|waiver), task, home,
# commit (the AgentLab commit the checkpoint file lives at), path (the
# checkpoint's path inside the AgentLab clone), branch (the AgentLab durable
# branch it must be reachable from, default "main"), app_branch, app_head (the
# task's application-repo branch head at checkpoint time, or "" when no
# worktree existed yet), timestamp (the checkpoint's own recorded time), and
# recorded_at (when this receipt was ingested into the log). A waiver line
# additionally carries captain_words.
#
# fm_preservation_verify re-reads the newest receipt of the requested kind and
# re-derives every fact from the AgentLab clone and (for a final check) the
# task's own worktree, rather than trusting the receipt's own claims: a stale,
# unpushed, unreachable, or validator-failing checkpoint is refused with an
# exact reason, and a missing clone, missing validator, or network failure is
# refused rather than silently skipped. There is no cache; every call re-fetches.
#
# AGENTLAB_ROOT resolves to $FM_HOME/projects/agentlab-shared-memory by
# default (the AGENTS.md project-clone layout), overridable with
# FM_PRESERVATION_AGENTLAB_ROOT for a task home whose clone lives elsewhere and
# for tests. FM_PRESERVATION_OFFLINE=1 passes --offline to the AgentLab
# validator (its own PR/commit-URL network checks only); it never skips the
# fetch or reachability check here, which is what proves "pushed and
# reachable" rather than merely "the receipt claims a commit".
